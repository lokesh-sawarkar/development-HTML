# Feasto – Online Food Ordering Site

Simple static website for the **Feasto** food ordering service built with HTML and CSS.

## What this project has

- Landing page (`index.html`) with hero section, services, popular dishes carousel and footer.
- Order page (`order.html`) with an order form that collects user details, food choice and payment method.
- Feedback page (`feedback.html`) with a short feedback form and star rating.
- Shared header and footer styles in `CSS/style.css`, plus page-specific styles in `CSS/order.css` and `CSS/feedback.css`.

## Things to remember for future

- Update navigation in all three HTML files together so header links stay consistent.
- Logo should always bring the user back to the home section of the site.
- Keep layouts responsive: check on mobile width before finalizing any major change.
- Images and videos are stored under `images/` and `videos/` – replace these files to change visuals without editing HTML.
- After local changes, push to GitHub and, if using GitHub Pages, confirm the Pages settings still point to the correct branch and folder.

## Quick deploy reminder (GitHub)

1. Initialize Git in the project folder: `git init`.
2. Add and commit: `git add .` then `git commit -m "update"`.
3. Add remote: `git remote add origin <your-repo-URL>`.
4. Push: `git push -u origin main`.
5. Enable GitHub Pages in the repo **Settings → Pages** and open the generated URL.
